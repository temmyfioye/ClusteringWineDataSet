This analysis applies K-means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to partition a dataset into groups. Standard Scaler yielded higher ARI scores, while Robust Scaler resulted in better silhouette scores. Scaling choice impacts clustering performance, depending on dataset characteristics and analysis requirements.
