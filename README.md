# Clustering Wine DataSet
This analysis applies K-means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to partition a dataset into groups. Standard Scaler yielded higher Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) scores, while Robust Scaler resulted in better silhouette scores. Scaling choice impacts clustering performance, depending on dataset characteristics and analysis requirements.
